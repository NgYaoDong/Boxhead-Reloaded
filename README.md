## Gamemodes
* Survival
  * The player starts the game as he spawns with a pistol with infinite ammo to kill monsters that spawn randomly at the four different spawn points.
  * The player will play level by level, and the level will be declared complete when all waves of monsters in the level are killed.
  * Weapon boxes drop randomly when enemies are killed and contain new weapons or weapon upgrades.
  * The higher the level, the stronger the enemies are, and their numbers increase with each wave.
***
* Dark Survival (In Development)
  * Similar to Survival, but with a twist. The entire room is dark (not visible to the player) except for a small illuminated circular area around the player.
  * Increased difficulty due to the visibility and challenges player instinct and reaction.
