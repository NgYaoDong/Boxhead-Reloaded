**Setup for player**
1. Launch our current game on itch.io here: [Latest build](https://physiquemetal.itch.io/boxhead-reloaded)
2. Click campaign/infinite mode to start and fight the zombies!

## Gamemodes
* Campaign
  * The player starts the game as he spawns with a pistol with infinite ammo to kill monsters that spawn randomly.
  * The player will play level by level, and the level will be declared complete when all waves of monsters in the level are killed.
  * Weapon boxes drop randomly when enemies are killed and contain new weapons or ammo reload.
  * All weapons unlocked in the previous levels will be refilled to full ammo upon entrance of a new level.
  * The higher the level, the stronger the enemies are, and their numbers increase with each wave.
* Infinite Mode
  * The player begins the game as he spawns, armed with an infinite ammo pistol, ready to kill monsters that spawn at random at the four different spawn points.
  * Weapon boxes, which contain new weapons or ammo reloads, drop at random when enemies are killed.
  * As more waves are cleared, the stronger the enemies become, and their numbers increase with each wave.

***
* Infinite Darkness (In development)
  * Similar to Infinite Mode, but with a twist. The entire room is dark (not visible to the player) except for a small illuminated circular area around the player.
  * Increased difficulty due to the visibility and challenges player instinct and reaction.
